# Weather API<br>
<a href="https://zacfisher1990.github.io/weather_api/" target="_blank">Web Page </a> <br>
The purpose of this project is to allow the user to search a city and see a 5 day forecast for that city.<br>
When the user searches a city a button appears in the search history section.<br>
When the user clicks the button of the searched city the page shows the 5 day forecast.<br>
When the user enters a city that doesn't exist a message appears that says, "city not found".<br>
